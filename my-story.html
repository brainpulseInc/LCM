                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p><strong>Having a successful career and a hefty bank account does not always make you happy. I learned that the hard way.</strong></p>
                    <p>And maybe you are starting to realize this as well. If so, I have a story that might help...</p>
                    <p>Not so long ago, I was an overachiever on the brink of burnout. I had a thriving business and all of the appearances of having achieved ultimate success. But appearances can be, and often are, deceiving. That is why I am here to help you.</p>
                    <p>In reality, I was overwhelmed, stressed out and unfulfilled. If that is where you are right now, I know how you feel.</p>
                    <p>But my own story taught me something invaluable: dramatic transformation is possible.</p>

                    <h2>When Success Doesn’t Equal Happiness</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Morocco and quickly learned the value of money. It is a lesson that has served me well throughout my life.</p>
                    <p>After leaving Morocco, I worked tirelessly across North America, China and Europe in a range of careers in software development, real estate, executive consulting, and entrepreneurship.</p>
                    <p>The global exposure, along with living and working in many foreign cultures, taught me the uniqueness and importance of cultural sensitivity when it comes to business and personal affairs.</p>
                    <p>Language barriers, and dealing with them as a professional immigrant, taught me the importance of patience, understanding, and how to present concepts in a unique way for whomever I dealt with. I was incredibly successful in my professional realm and established long­lasting business relationships across the globe.</p>
                    <p>My hard work paid off. By the time I turned 30, I had built up to a $1 million portfolio. I helped multinational entrepreneurs of many different walks of life grow their business. I became a consultant to several Fortune 500 companies.</p>
                    <p>On the surface, I looked like I had it all. But something was just not right.</p>
                    <p>No matter how much professional praise I received or money I made, I did not feel satisfied. I became increasingly frustrated at not being able to scale up my own business and could not see a way out.</p>
                    <p>Life was not working out as I wanted it to. I was tired. I was frustrated. I felt hopeless. Something had to change, and I realized the answer to the question of WHAT was within me.</p>

                    <h2>A Search For Help</h2>
                    <p>If I was ever going to be successful  and happy, I knew I could not do it alone. That is when I sought the help of multiple life coaches, mentors, meditation masters and, ultimately, created the balanced life I have today.</p>
                    <p>But then I realized something: countless other people must be facing the same problems I had, unsure where to turn next.</p>
                    <p>That is what led me to set up Life Coach Montreal.</p>
                    <p>Today, I use  my unique experience, business background and expertize in the technology sector to help  businesses and individuals reach their full potential.</p>
